# TWITTER CREDENTIALS
#
# When you register your app with dev.twitter.com, you'll
# need to generate an access token. Fill in the following
# strings with the correct info below.
twitter_access = {
    'consumer_key': '',
    'consumer_secret': '',
    'access_token_key': '',
    'access_token_secret': '',
}
#
# DROPBOX CREDENTIALS
#
# Dropbox uses similar authentication as Twitter, but
# it just requires a single access key. When you create
# your app in Dropbox, click "Generate Access Token" and
# copy and paste the string here.
